rule: |
  When you must use a function expression (as when passing an anonymous function), use arrow
  function notation.
reason: |
  Why? It creates a version of the function that executes in the context of this, which is usually
  what you want, and is a more concise syntax.

  Why not? If you have a fairly complicated function, you might move that logic out into its own
  function declaration.
